## Reversible Causes

- TSH/T4
- CMP: BUN/Cr
- LFT: liver cirrhosis
- B12
- RPR
- Screen for depression/pseudodementia
- CT/MRI: look for hydrocephalus, hematoma

## Dementia, delirium, amnesia, MCI

- Dementia: cognitive impairment (attention, concentration, speech), memory loss; chronic, insiduous, permanent
- Delirium: cognitive impairment, memory loss; acute, overt, wax/wane, reversible
- Amnesia: no cognitive impairment, memory loss

| Normal aging                        | mild cognitive impairment | Dementia   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| cognitive test -                    | test +                    | test +     |
| function normal (act independently) | function normal           | function - |

### MCI:

- mild cognitive impairment without functional impairment
- MOCA: <26 or < 25 for less educated
- 1/2 develop dementia in 5 years

## Dementia

- population
	- 1/3 people at 90 years old
	- 1/10 people at 80 year old
	- 1/20 people at 70 year old
- Normal aging: slowing over time, short term memory should be ok
- Dementia = cognitive impairment (moca) and functional impairment (IADL/ADL)
- Diagnoses based on functional status and not based on MOCA alone
- IADL: driving, meds, finances
- ADL: bathing, dressing, eating
- Takes 10 years on average to go from early to late dementia
- Early dementia:
	- only IADL impaired
	- tangential, paucity of thoughts
	- short term memory loss, execution problems
	- MOCA < 20 or 15
- Moderate dementia:
	- some ADL impairment
	- speak 1-2 sentences
- Late dementia:
	- all ADL impairment
	- problems with ambulation, eating, falling
	- 2-3 words
- Death: from pneumonia, fall, hip fx

## Dementia Medications

- Sertraline 25 mg, increase every 2 weeks to 200 mg
- Celexa/citalopram: 10-40mg, minimum drug drug interaction, no CYP
- Lexapro/escitalopram: 5-20mg, no QTC prolongation
- Seroquel
- Depakote: 125 mg - 250 mg for sundowning

### Early dementia

- use ACH I: Donepezil QD, Rivastigmine BID (patch), galantamine
- 2-3 pts better on testing
- delay decline slightly
- does not stop progression
- works better in 1/3 ppl, 1/3 same, 1/3 bad SE
- SE: GI, diarrhea, dizziness, **bradycardia**
